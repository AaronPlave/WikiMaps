WikiMaps lets you select locations from text on the web, displays them on a custom Google map, and pulls summaries of each item from Wikipedia. Feel free to add any location that can be found on Google Maps (and optionally on Wikipedia).

How to Use:

---Viewing the map--- 
Click on the WikiMaps icon in the extensions icon toolbar in the upper right hand corner of the screen. Then click "Display Map"

---Adding a location to WikiMaps---
1. Highlight some text, right click, and select "Add to WikiMaps" in the menu.
2. In the map page (after you click "Display Map") you can enter locations to add in the "Add Locations" area.

---Removing locations---
To remove a particular location, press the "x" button to the right of the location. To clear all locations, click the WikiMaps icon and then click "Clear List".

---Viewing Wikipedia Summary---
To view the Wikipedia summary, click on an item in the map view and then click on "Summary" in the information window that appears above the map marker.


Other Features/Notes:
-Locations are saved locally and will be reloaded in the event you close your browser.
-You can sort the locations in the tables alphabetically by clicking on the "Location" label in the table.
-If WikiMaps is unable to identify the location you attempted to add, the location will not be added.
-Not all locations will have complete or any Wikipedia data.

Future Improvements:
-Improve geocoding by pulling new coordinates from Wikipedia if data is found on Wikipedia for a location.
-Error handling if WikiMaps is unable to add a location.
-Better responsiveness to different window sizes.
